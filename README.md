# kdt-tool
General-purpose tool for Konami's sequenced music format "KDT1".


### Dependencies
All you need is Python 3. The tool was developed under Python 3.4.2 and has NOT been tested with any other version.


### Usage
The script currently takes no arguments other than a filepath. Thus, **provided you're on Windows and installed Python 3 using the official MSI installer, you should be able to simply drop any valid KDT1 file onto the script file to convert it to MIDI**. For now, you will have to hard-code calls to the other available functions if you so desire to use them.
